# Password Generator

## Description

The Password Generator is a crucial tool in today's digital age, where data breaches are rampant and the need for robust security is paramount. Motivated by the increasing threats to data security and the common pitfalls in password creation, this project was conceived to offer a solution to weak or predictable passwords. Rather than relying on human tendencies which might lean towards easily guessable passwords, this tool ensures the generation of a strong, randomized password based on user-defined criteria. Through the development of this project, I gained deeper insights into user experience design, ensuring that security and usability go hand in hand.
